# Recipes API

#### Insert your leftover ingredients and explore thousands of recipes.

## Description

This project is an open-source recipes api. The original purpose was to work with a website called "CookCycle" for managing the server-side functionality (recipes, ingredients, users' favorites and more).<br/>
The website is down at the moment, a demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFIF0JuBN04).

For a better code-exploring experience I added "Doxygen" documentation, simply clone the project to your PC and open the index.html file at the path:

"./recipes-api/Documentation/html/index.html"

## Tools

Java, Spring Boot, Maven, MySQL, JUnit, Doxygen
